<p>Just turned 67 on May 1 of 2023, retired after a heart attack slowed me up.</p>
<p>I've had a good life, 5 kids, 10 grandkids. Busy times. </p>
<p>Always had a interest in electronics and all things techy. Ham radio, private pilot, kind of a photographer. All kind of
  stuff to amuse myself.</p>
